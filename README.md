# Root_Finder
Finding Roots using Newton's, Secant, and Bisection methods.

This program dynammically finds the roots of polynomials using Newton's, Secant and Bisection methods
	using the data.txt file. The first line of the file represents the degree of the polynomial,
	the second line represents the coeffecients of the polynomial, and the third represents the domain of the
	x values being used to find the root. With the use of vectors, the data gets input and manipulated using the
	functions below. 

### Instructions:
1. Compile and run source: ```g++ source.cpp && ./a.out```
2. When prompted, enter a filename for a txt file to use as he coeffcient factors (use data.txt or data1.txt)
3. Examine and observe the resuts of the three methods given the polynomial coefficents in step 2.


See Report.docx for more details on data.txt and data1.txt.
